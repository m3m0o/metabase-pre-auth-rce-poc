The **command** will be executed on the target machine with the intention of obtaining a **reverse shell**. You can find different options in [RevShells](https://revshells.com). Having the **setup-token** value and the **command** that will be executed, you can run the script with the following command:

```python3 main.py -u http://[targeturl] -t [setup-token] -c "[command]"```
